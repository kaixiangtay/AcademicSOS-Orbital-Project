# AcademicSOS React Native Mobile Application (Orbital)

<INSERT some header pic here>

AcademicSOS is a cross-platform mobile application that allows NUS students, professors and teaching assistants to easily book, create and keep track of consultations. 

The application allows all consultation matters to be done solely on the application, without requiring the need to email or message professors and teaching assistants. This will help in reducing email spams to professorsâ€™s inboxes and also increase the monitoring rate
